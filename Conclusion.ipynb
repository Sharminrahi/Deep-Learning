        "\n",
        "In conclusion, I evaluated the performance of four convolutional neural networks - Pre trained MobileNet V2, DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16 - for flower classification on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). Based on the experiments, I observed the following results:\n",
        "\n",
        "- MobileNet V2 achieved the highest accuracy of 78%, making it the most suitable model for this task among the tested networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- DenseNet121 closely followed MobileNet V2 with an accuracy of 75%, indicating it could also be a viable option for flower classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ResNet50 had a considerably lower accuracy of 39%, suggesting it may not be the best choice for this specific dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- VGG16 performed poorly, with an accuracy of only 2%, which demonstrates that it is not a suitable model for the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings suggest that, for the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset, MobileNet V2 and DenseNet121 are the most effective pretrained models among the ones tested. In particular, MobileNet V2 stands out as the top-performing model, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying flower images with a relatively high accuracy. Future work could explore further fine-tuning of these models, data augmentation techniques, and other network architectures to potentially achieve even better performance. It is important to note that such endeavors can be time-consuming and computationally demanding. As a result, future work in this area should carefully consider the balance between performance gains and the required resources before embarking on additional model optimization.\n"
